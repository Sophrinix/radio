# radio

A SDR (Software Defined Radio) written in crystal. Soon. Sorry I tied up the name without providing a real SDR yet. If this is still a dummy project by December 1st then feel free to message me on twitter @sophrinix and ask wth.

## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  radio:
    github: sophrinix/radio
```


## Usage


```crystal
require "radio"
```


I will publish a real SDR soon.
